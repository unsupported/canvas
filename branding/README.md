# Branding Canvas with CSS and JavaScript

This folder contains some example CSS and JavaScript files that can be used to give Canvas your institution's look and feel. There are several subfolders that denote the purpose of each set of CSS/JS files. These are described below.

As always, this is provided AS-IS, without warranty, and without any support beyond this document and anyone kind enough to help from the community.

# Installation

To use a custom CSS or JavaScript file, you must enable these features in your General Account Management page. A link to this page is available in the "Admin" slide out menu if you are an administrator for your account on the global navigation. If you are not an administrator, you will need to either request permission or ask for your existing administrator to enable these features for you.

Once enabled, you'll need to accomplish one of the following to enable your branding:

Uploading the file directly into Canvas.
---
1. Upload a valid .css or .js extension into the theme editor.
2. Save changes and wait for theme editor to apply changes.
3. Test!

Account Configuration
-------

When you have your file ready to upload, navigate to the Theme Editor. Please be aware that these files are visible to anyone, anywhere, you're ready to configure your institution's Canvas account. Again, if you aren't an administrator, you'll need to either request administrator privileges or ask your administrator to apply these settings.

1. Click on your institution's general account management link (from the "Admin" slide out menu).
2. Click on "Open Theme Editor" button in the right hand side of the page.
3. Select Upload in the Theme Editor menu.
4. Enter the URL for each file (the CSS and JavaScript files) in the text fields labeled, "JavaScript File" and "CSS File".
5. Click "Apply"

Your browser should refresh the current page and apply the branding.
