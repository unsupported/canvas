Default "load in a new tab" checkbox is checked
======

This script will automatically select "load in a new tab" to a new a new module item. It can still be unselected by the user, but it starts out checked.

The included screenshot shows the external URL option selected and the "Load in a new tab" checkbox selected.

No need to set variable on this script.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
