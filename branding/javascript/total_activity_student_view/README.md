# Show student total course activity time

By adding the JS in this folder to your Canvas instance, it will run an API call on behalf of the student to get their activity time when they are in a course.

**Note**: As with any part of Canvas, the links that these CSS Selectors target could change at any time. Be sure to check your beta environment before each production release to be sure that none of your JS/CSS has broken due to an upcoming code change.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
