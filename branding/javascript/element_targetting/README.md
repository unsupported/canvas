# element_targeting

## Summary
Each view in Canvas has been whittled down to include the necessary `unique classes` or `IDs` that will enable you to target elements in the UI with JavaScript.  Where applicable, instructions have been added for both **disabling** items in the UI and **hiding** items completely.
