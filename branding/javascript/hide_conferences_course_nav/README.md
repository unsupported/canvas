# Hide Conferences Course Navigation Link

This option hides the "Conferences" course navigation link in all courses for all users, as well as the "Conferences" navigation item in the course navigation configuration interface.

**Note**: As with any part of Canvas, the links that these CSS rules target could change at any time. Be sure to check your beta environment before each production release to be sure that none of your CSS has broken due to an upcoming code change.

## Support

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
