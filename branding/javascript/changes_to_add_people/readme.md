#Add People Window

You can use this script to modify the add people window on the course level. You can modify the placeholder text, hide an option, and hide choices in the roles dropdown. This script is a base starting point. It is highly recommended that you have someone who is capable of editing JavaScript files.

Variable
- Edit the onlyAdmin variable to false if you want the changes to apply to everyone and true if you want the changes to apply to everyone except admins.


Support

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
