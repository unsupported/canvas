Adding a second checkbox to the terms and conditions
======

This script will add another checkbox to the terms and conditions.

In this script you will need to include the URL for your organizations terms and privacy policy
- These changes should occur on two variables marked in the script as "terms" and "privacy".

Currently the second checkbox is not collected, stored or processed in any way, but it does prevent the user from getting past the agree to terms and conditions screen to get into Canvas.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
