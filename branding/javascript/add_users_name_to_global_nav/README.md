# Add the user's full name to the Global Navigation Menu

This JS adds the user's full name in place of the "account" text under the user avatar on the Canvas Global Navigation Menu.

**Note**: As with any part of Canvas, the values that this code target could change at any time. Be sure to check your beta environment before each production release to be sure that this code is still functional as Canvas changes.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
