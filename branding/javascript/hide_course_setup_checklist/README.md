# Hide Course Setup Checklist

Important: Both the javascript and CSS are needed for this to function.

This option hides the "Need help setting up your course?" block and "Course Setup Checklist" button from the homepage of a course for all users.

**Note**: As with any part of Canvas, the links that these CSS rules target could change at any time. Be sure to check your beta environment before each production release to be sure that none of your CSS has broken due to an upcoming code change.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
