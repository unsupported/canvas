Add Google Preview Links if missing
=========================================
DEPRECATED AS OF 04/19/2016

If you disable Scribd and are unfortunate enough to have missing document preview links
after the change, this script may come in handy.  It scans the page for Canvas file
links and adds the preview button to those files that are previewable.

Use at your own risk.


Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
