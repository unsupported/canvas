Bulk Create Discussions/Announcements.readme

This script will create a discussion or announcement in multiple courses.

To use the script, generate a CSV that contains a column for canvas_course_id
- This column should be populated with the numeric Canvas course IDs (not SIS IDs) of the targeted courses

Fill in the User Editable Area in the script to populate what you would like the discussion or announcement to contain, and which type you'd like to create.

Code notes next to #'s will walk you through the rest.
